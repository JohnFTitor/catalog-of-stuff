# Catalog of Stuff

> Ruby Capstone Project meant to wrap the concepts of Ruby language and SQL Databases, creating a OOP project based on an UML diagram

> In this project, we created a console app that will help us to keep a record of different types of things we won: books, music albums, and games. Everything will be based on the UML class diagram presented below. The data will be stored in JSON files but we also prepared a database with tables structure analogical to our program's class structure.
